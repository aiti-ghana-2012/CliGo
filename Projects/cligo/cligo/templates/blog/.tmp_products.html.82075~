			CliGO is an SMS based system that sends health tips on diet and precautionary
measures to expectant mothers who are subscribed. This service is free and would
be funded with grants from governmental and non-governmental organisations. The
system sends messages in three forms: General health tips, Dietary health tips and Preventive and precautionary health tips

			<br>
			<br>
			The general health tips cover the day-to-day activities of expectant mothers such as
sleeping postures and so on. The dietary health tips cover only the dietary needs of
the expectant mothers. That includes special foods that should be taken and why they
should be taken, these are also more specific to the exact period of pregnancy. The
preventive and precautionary health tips are also specific to the period (number of
weeks) of pregnancy. During later stages of implementation, voice messaging and voice
calls would be added to the system to cater for the less educated in the community.
